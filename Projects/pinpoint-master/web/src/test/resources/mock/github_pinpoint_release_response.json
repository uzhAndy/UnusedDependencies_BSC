1.6.0 release note\n\n**You must create 2 new HBase tables if you are upgrading from a previous release.**\n\n```\nAgentStatV2\nTraceV2\n```\n\nFor more information on what these tables do, please refer to the _Trace/AgentStat improvements_ section below.\n\n### ASM\n\nWe have changed our default bytecode instrumentation engine from Javassist to ASM and you will now experience faster application startup time especially in an environment with a lot of Spring beans.\nThis change also allows us to add powerful new APIs for you to utilize when developing plugins in the future.\n\nWe have added the following option to _pinpoint.config_ to configure bytecode instrumentation engine used by the agent.\n\n**pinpoint.config**\n\n```\nprofiler.instrument.engine=ASM\n```\n\nPossible values are:\n- ASM (**default**) - uses ASM for bytecode instrumentation\n- JAVASSIST - uses Javassist for bytecode instrumentation\n\nPlease note that JAVASSIST instrumentation is deprecated and will be removed in future release.\n\n### Trace/AgentStat improvements\n\nHuge improvements have been made to storing trace and agent stat data. We've experienced upwards of **60-70% improvement in I/O performance and storage capacity** internally.\n**We highly recommend you create the following tables when upgrading from 1.5.x.**\n\n```\nAgentStatV2\nTraceV2\n```\n\nWe have added the following options to _pinpoint-collector.properties_ and _pinpoint-web.properties_ to configure which tables to use.\nDefault values have been set to ensure backwards compatibility so you most likely will not need to change anything after creating the tables above.\n\n**pinpoint-collector.properties**\n\n```\ncollector.span.format.compatibility.version=v2\ncollector.stat.format.compatibility.version=v2\n```\n\nPossible values are:\n- v1 - writes data to `AgentStat/Trace` table.\n- v2 (**default**) - writes data to `AgentStatV2/TraceV2` table.\n- dualWrite - writes data to `AgentStat/Trace` and `AgentStatV2/TraceV2` tables.\n\n**pinpoint-web.properties**\n\n```\nweb.span.format.compatibility.version=compatibilityMode \nweb.stat.format.compatibility.version=compatibilityMode \n```\n\nPossible values are:\n- v1 - reads data from `AgentStat/Trace` table.\n- v2 - reads data from `AgentStatV2/TraceV2` table.\n- compatibilityMode (**default**) - reads data from `AgentStatV2/TraceV2` and if nothing is found, reads data from `AgentStat/Trace` tables.\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n## Known Issues\n- When profiling Jboss, you must set `profiler.instrument.engine=JAVASSIST` in _pinpoint.config_\n  <br><br>\n\n## Plugins\n-

1.6.0-RC1 release note\n\n**You must create 2 new HBase tables if you are upgrading from a previous release.**\n\n```\nAgentStatV2\nTraceV2\n```\n\nFor more information on what these tables do, please refer to the _Trace/AgentStat improvements_ section below.\n\n### ASM\n\nWe have changed our default bytecode instrumentation engine from Javassist to ASM and you will now experience faster application startup time especially in an environment with a lot of Spring beans.\nThis change also allows us to add powerful new APIs for you to utilize when developing plugins in the future.\n\nWe have added the following option to _pinpoint.config_ to configure bytecode instrumentation engine used by the agent.\n\n**pinpoint.config**\n\n```\nprofiler.instrument.engine=ASM\n```\n\nPossible values are:\n- ASM (**default**) - uses ASM for bytecode instrumentation\n- JAVASSIST - uses Javassist for bytecode instrumentation\n\nPlease note that JAVASSIST instrumentation is deprecated and will be removed in future release.\n\n### Trace/AgentStat improvements\n\nHuge improvements have been made to storing trace and agent stat data. We've experienced upwards of **60-70% improvement in I/O performance and storage capacity** internally.\n**We highly recommend you create the following tables when upgrading from 1.5.x.**\n\n```\nAgentStatV2\nTraceV2\n```\n\nWe have added the following options to _pinpoint-collector.properties_ and _pinpoint-web.properties_ to configure which tables to use.\nDefault values have been set to ensure backwards compatibility so you most likely will not need to change anything after creating the tables above.\n\n**pinpoint-collector.properties**\n\n```\ncollector.span.format.compatibility.version=v2\ncollector.stat.format.compatibility.version=v2\n```\n\nPossible values are:\n- v1 - writes data to `AgentStat/Trace` table.\n- v2 (**default**) - writes data to `AgentStatV2/TraceV2` table.\n- dualWrite - writes data to `AgentStat/Trace` and `AgentStatV2/TraceV2` tables.\n\n**pinpoint-web.properties**\n\n```\nweb.span.format.compatibility.version=compatibilityMode \nweb.stat.format.compatibility.version=compatibilityMode \n```\n\nPossible values are:\n- v1 - reads data from `AgentStat/Trace` table.\n- v2 - reads data from `AgentStatV2/TraceV2` table.\n- compatibilityMode (**default**) - reads data from `AgentStatV2/TraceV2` and if nothing is found, reads data from `AgentStat/Trace` tables.\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n## Plugins\n- Added Hystrix support - #1594, #2101 (Contributed by jiaqifeng)\n- Added ActiveMQ support - #1709\n- Added Apache cxf client
