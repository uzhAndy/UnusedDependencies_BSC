  This issue/proposal has been automatically marked as stale because it hasn't had any recent activity.
  It will automatically be closed if no further activity occurs for 20days.
  If you think this should still be open, or the problem still persists,
  just pop a reply in the comments and one of the maintainers will (try!) to follow up.
  Thank you for your interest and contribution to the Pinpoint Community.
